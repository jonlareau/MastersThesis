{train,devtest,evaltest}.doc
----------------------------

	The files 'train.doc,' 'devtest.doc' and 'evaltest.doc'
	contain the distribution of calls by language, and by gender
	and #utterances within each language, for the three data sets.
	The gaps in the call number sequence in each language reflect
	the deletion of invalid/prank/unsuitable calls.
	
	The shortened acronyms 'nlg', 'clg', 'dow', 'roo', 'mea',
	'stb', and 'sta' refer to the nlang, clang, dowk, room, meal,
	story-bt and story-at utterances respectively.  (These latter
	designations are the strings used in the original OGI tape
	distrbution.)
	
	The gender of the caller is juxtaposed with each call number.
	For some calls, the laboratory assistants could not determine
	the gender of the caller. In such cases, it is listed as 'u'
	(for unknown).

	The totals (calls and utterances) for each language and the
	overall GRAND TOTAL are also given.

{train,devtest,evaltest}.lst
----------------------------

	The files 'train.lst,' 'devtest.lst' and 'evaltest.lst'
	contain a list of the calls from each language that are
	included in that data set, along with a listing of the
	utterances from each call. This information is provided since
	a number of calls do not contain all the 10 utterances.
	
	The shortened acronyms 'nlg', 'clg', 'dow', 'roo', 'mea',
	'stb', and 'sta' refer to the nlang, clang, dowk, room, meal,
	story-bt and story-at utterances respectively.  (These latter
	designations are the strings used in the original OGI tape
	distrbution.)
