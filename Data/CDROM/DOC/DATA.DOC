The speech and transcription filenames are of the form:

<langcode><callnumber><type>.wav - compressed waveform data, with 1024
				byte uncompressed SPHERE header

<langcode><callnumber><type>.seg - time-aligned broad phonetic 
                                transcriptions

<langcode><callnumber>.log  - information file containing results of
                                preliminary verification and evaluation 
                                of each call

where:

<langcode> consists of the first two letters of the ten language
	names. E.g. fa (Farsi), vi (Vietnamese), etc.

<callnumber>  positive 3-digit integer (with leading zeros as needed)

<type> any one of:
	nlg - native language 
	clg - common language 
	dow - days of the week
	num - number 0 thru 10
	htl - hometown likes 
	htc - hometown climate 
	roo - room description
	mea - description of most recent meal
	stb - free speech before the tone
	sta - free speech after the tone

The stb (max. duration 50 seconds) and sta (max. 10 seconds)
utterances together form the 1-minute free speech portion of each
call. The explanation below clarifies the reasons for this breakup
into two files.

  Instead of abruptly cutting off the caller at the end of 1 minute,
  it was decided, based on trial runs of the recording protocol, to
  play a "time is up" tone after the first 50 seconds, to inform the 
  caller that (s)he had only 10 seconds left to bring his/her free 
  speech response to a coherent end. Callers were explained the purpose 
  of this tone and were played a sample tone before the actual 1-minute
  recording began. The software of the Gradient Desklab dictated that 
  the response before and after the tone be recorded in separate files.
