Phase II Log File Documentation

Phase II involved verification of the utterances by native speakers of
the individual languages, including: 

  (1) confirming that each utterance was in fact spoken by a native
	speaker of that language;
  (2) verifying that the caller followed the instructions for that
	utterance; 
  (3) judging the callers' accents and dialects, and
  (4) providing a brief description of the topic of each caller's
	one-minute elicited free speech response.


Log File Format

Files ending with ".lg2" are the information (ASCII text) files
containing the qualitative judgments.  For all the calls in a
particular language a native speaker of the language was used to make
all judgements.

The log file consists of a two-line header, a body containing
utterance-specific judgments and global judgements.

The header:

	<callnumber> labeler <labeler_name>  
	<callnumber> label_date <date>	     

The body:

	<callnumber> <utt_type> <attribute> <values>

where

<callnumber> -- self-explanatory

<utt_type> -- nlang, clang, htl, htc, room, meal, story-bt, story-at,
              generally in that order

For each <utt_type>, the following attribute-value pairs are present:

<attribute>        <values>
  speech_type       extemp
                    read
                    recite

<topic>             a one-line summary of the topic of the story

<desc>              a one-line description of speech_type, dialect,
                    accent, background speech, or environmental noise.


The <speech_type> attribute only applies to the story portions of the
calls.  The values for this attribute indicate whether the story was
more than half extemporaneous speech (extemp), read speech (read), or
recited (recite).  If the speech does not fall into any of the above
categories, the labeler is required to briefly describe the
speech_type of the story.

The <topic> attribute also only applies to the story protions of the
calls.  The labeler was asked to summarize (in english) what the
caller talked about in the story.

When applied to the <nlg> utterance type the <native> attribute has
a value of yes if the caller answered with the language name of the
language being recorded.  If the speaker did not say the language
name, <native> is set to no and the labeler makes a judgment whether
the speech signal is still useful speech.  If so, <useful> is set to
yes, otherwise to no.  When applied as a general comment, the <native>
attribute has a value of yes if the labeler judges that the caller is
a native speaker of the language (regardless of how the caller
answered the <nlang> question).

The <complete> attribute is only applied to the <dow> and <num>
utterance types.  A value of yes means that all the days of the week
or numbers zero to ten were present in the speech sample.  If only
part of a list exists then <complete> is set to no and <partial> is
set to yes.  If there is not even a partial list then <partial> is
set to no and the labeler makes a judgement as to whether the speech
data is still useful speech. If so, <useful> is set to yes, otherwise
to no.

The <instructions> attribute applies to all utterance types except the
stories, <nlg>, <dow>, and <num>.  If the labeler judged that the
caller followed the instructions for each utterance type then the
<instructions> attribute is set to yes.  When the caller did not
follow instructions the labeler judged whether the speech was still
useful.  If so, <useful> was set to yes, otherwise to no.

The attributes <dialect>, <accent>, <background speech>,
<environmental noise>, <gender>, <age>, <intelligibility>, and
<connection> apply globally.  These are judgments made by the labeler
about dialect, accent, etc.
