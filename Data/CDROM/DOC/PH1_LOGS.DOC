Phase I Log File Documentation

Development of MLTS corpus has been divided into two phases.  log
files generated in Phase I (in "logs" directory) consisted of: 

  (a) preliminary verification: listening to each utterance and
	deleting prank or invalid calls (hangups);
  (b) chopping: removing excess noise at the beginning and end of each
	utterance;
  (c) evaluation: making several judgments about the quality and type
	of speech;
  (d) broad phonetic transcriptions}: providing time-aligned broad
	phonetic labels to a subset of the utterances.

Phase II, involved: 

  (a) verification and evaluation of the utterances by native speakers
	of the individual languages,
  (b) orthographic transcriptions of each utterance,


Phase I tasks were carried out by trained laboratory assistants who 
are native speakers of English. An interactive graphics program
was used to display the waveform, play the utterance, and to
log information into a text file.

Each utterance was processed as follows:

     The utterance was chopped, if necessary, to remove the excess 
     noise and/or silence before and after the speech. Care was taken
     to include at least 300 ms of ``silence'' before and after the
     speech. Audible lip-smacks and breath noise were always 
     retained.

     Judgments were made about the quality and content of 
     speech in each utterance. The listener noted the occurrence of 
     any of the following:

	(i)   American or British accents (applicable to English calls only);
	(ii)  excessive breath noise;
	(iii) speech cut off at the beginning;
	(iv)  speech cut off at the end;
	(v)   environmental noise;
	(vi)  caller did not follow instructions;
	(vii) caller not a native speaker;
	(viii)read speech;
	(ix)  spontaneous speech;
	(x)   extraneous speech; and
	(xi)  speech in non-native language


A set of automatic measurements was made on the utterance.  These
include its duration, the minimum and maximum sample values, the dc
offset, and 10th and 90th percentile of the power (in dB) measured
over 10 ms windows in the utterance.

The ``caller not a native speaker'' comment for languages other than
English was made only if the speaker admitted to being a non-native
speaker in response to the ``native language'' question.  A more
accurate determination of the number of non-native speakers in other
languages will be made during Phase II.  ``Extraneous speech'' refers
to background speech produced by someone other than the caller.

The laboratory assistants were trained to recognize the fixed
vocabularies in each language and were able to detect incomplete
responses and non-standard pronunciations of the days-of-the-week and
the numbers.

In addition to these utterance-specific comments and measurements, the
following "global" judgments were made after listening to all
utterances of a call:

	(i)   gender (male, female and unknown);
	(ii)  age (child, adult);
	(iii) connection quality (poor, average, good); and
	(iv)  speaker intelligibility (poor, typical).\vspace{2mm}
